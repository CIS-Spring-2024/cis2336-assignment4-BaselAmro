                <h2>About the Owner</h2>
                <p>I'm Basel Amro, a proud Cougar in my sophomore year at the University of Houston, majoring in Computer Information Systems. I'm channeling my passion for technology and community into developing a website that revolutionizes how UH students interact with their meals on campus. As a tech enthusiast and a food lover, I believe that a great dining experience can be the heart of our university life. This project is my way of enhancing our campus culture, one meal at a time.</p>

                <p>At the heart of our mission lies a commitment to providing wholesome, delicious food that fuels the minds and bodies of our students and staff. The Coug Cafe is more than just a place to eat; it's a hub where culture meets cuisine, where local ingredients meet international techniques, and where every meal is prepared with care and passion. The vision of Coug Cafe is brought to life by our esteemed Chef and Manager, Frank Pitts, a UH alumnus with a passion for culinary innovation and community building. With over a decade of experience in some of the most renowned kitchens across Texas, Chef Frank fuses local flavors with global inspiration, crafting dishes that are both familiar and exciting.</p>
